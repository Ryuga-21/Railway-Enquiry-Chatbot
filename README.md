<p>Created a chatbot for Railway Enquiry system, where user can interact with bot regarding ticket booking, informatoin of train schedule, general FAQs.
Since, India has one of the largest railway network this chatbot can bring about change in terms of money, labour and availability. As in most of the places in India where people have to wait for soo long in large queues to book their tickets or for any important information, due to its accessibilty, convinience and 24*7 availability makes this chatbot even better choice. </p>
